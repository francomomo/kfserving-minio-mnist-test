    "# Kubeflow Pipelines: from Training to Serving\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "With [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/) you can build entire workflows that automate the steps involved in going from training a machine learning model to actually serving an optimized version of it.\n",
    "These steps can be triggered automatically by a CI/CD workflow or on demand from a command line or notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubeflow Pipelines (`kfp`) comes with a user interface for managing and tracking experiments, jobs, and runs.\n",
    "A pipeline is a description of a machine learning workflow, replete with all inputs and outputs.\n",
    "In Kubeflow Pipelines, an **experiment** is a [workspace](../metadata/Metadata%20SDK.ipynb) where you can _experiment with_ different configuration of your pipelines.\n",
    "Experiments are a way to organize runs of jobs into logical groups.\n",
    "A **run** is simply a single execution (instance) of a pipeline.\n",
    "Kubeflow Pipelines also supports recurring runs, which is a repeatable run of a pipeline.\n",
    "Based on a so-called **run trigger** an instance of a pipeline with its run configuration is periodically started.\n",
    "As of now, [run triggers](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/overview/concepts/run-trigger/) are time-based (i.e. not event-based).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the UI, there is a pictorial representation of the runtime execution of a pipeline.\n",
    "This **graph** consists of one or more steps (i.e. nodes).\n",
    "Each step\n",
    "The directed edges (arrows) show the parent/child relationship: A &rarr; B means that B depends on A; B cannot start until A has successfully completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **component** performs a single step in the pipeline (e.g. data ingestion, data preprocessing, data transformation, model training, hyperparameter tuning).\n",
    "It is analogous to a function: it has a name, (metadata) parameters and return values (interface), and a body (implementation).\n",
    "It must therefore be self-contained.\n",
    "Each component must be packaged as a Docker image.\n",
    "Please note that components are independently executed: they do not share the same process and cannot share in-memory data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "This notebook trains a simple (MNIST) model in TensorFlow and serves it with [KFServing](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/serving/kfserving/), which is a serverless inference server.\n",
    "What this means is that you do not have to worry about which machines it runs on, networking, autoscaling, health checks, and what have you.\n",
    "Instead, you can focus on what matters to you: the model and a REST API you can call for predictions.\n",
    "If you are familiar with Kubernetes, you can even do [out-of-the-box canary deployments](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfserving/tree/master/docs/samples/tensorflow), in which a percentage of traffic is directed to the 'canary (in the coal mine)' with the latest model to ensure it functions properly before completely rolling out any (potentially problematic) updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer to use a more sophisticated model or a PyTorch-based one, you can check out the relevant notebooks: [MNIST with TensorFlow](../training/tensorflow/MNIST%20with%20TensorFlow.ipynb) or [MNIST with PyTorch](../training/pytorch/MNIST%20with%20PyTorch.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "KFServing reads the model file from [MinIO](https://min.io/), an open-source S3-compliant object storage tool, which is already included with your Kubeflow installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also use MinIO to provide the input data set to the pipeline. This way it can run without a connection to the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Need\n",
    "This notebook.\n",
    "\n",

    "    Imported packages must be available in the base image.<br><br>\n",
    "    Why? Because each component will be packaged as a Docker image.\n",
    "    The base image must therefore contain all dependencies.\n",
    "    Any dependencies you install manually in the notebook are invisible to the Python function once it's inside the image.\n",
    "    The function itself becomes the entrypoint of the image, which is why all auxiliary functions must be defined inside the function.\n",

    "## How to Combine the Components into a Pipeline\n",
    "Note that up to this point we have not yet used the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK!\n",
    "\n",
    "With our four components (i.e. self-contained functions) defined, we can wire up the dependencies with Kubeflow Pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The call [`components.func_to_container_op(f, base_image=img)(*args)`](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/sdk/sdk-overview/) has the following ingredients:\n",
    "- `f` is the Python function that defines a component\n",
    "- `img` is the base (Docker) image used to package the function\n",
    "- `*args` lists the arguments to `f`\n",
    "\n",
    "What the `*args` mean is best explained by going forward through the graph:\n",
    "- `downloadOp` is the very first step and has no dependencies; it therefore has no `InputPath`.\n",
    "  Its output (i.e. `OutputPath`) is stored in `data_dir`.\n",
    "- `trainOp` needs the data downloaded from `downloadOp` and its signature lists `data_dir` (input) and `model_dir` (output).\n",
    "  So, it _depends on_ `downloadOp.output` (i.e. the previous step's output) and stores its own outputs in `model_dir`, which can be used by another step.\n",
    "  `downloadOp` is the parent of `trainOp`, as required.\n",
    "- `evaluateOp`'s function takes three arguments: `data_dir` (i.e. `downloadOp.output`), `model_dir` (i.e. `trainOp.output`), and `metrics_path`, which is where the function stores its evaluation metrics.\n",
    "  That way, `evaluateOp` can only run after the successful completion of both `downloadOp` and `trainOp`.\n",
    "- `exportOp` runs the function `export_model`, which accepts five parameters: `model_dir`, `metrics`, `export_bucket`, `model_name`, and `model_version`.\n",
    "  From where do we get the `model_dir`?\n",
    "  It is nothing but `trainOp.output`.\n",
    "  Similarly, `metrics` is `evaluateOp.output`.\n",
    "  The remaining three arguments are regular Python arguments that are static for the pipeline: they do not depend on any step's output being available.\n",
    "  Hence, they are defined without using `InputPath`.\n",
    "- `kfservingOp` is loaded from the external component and its order of execution should be specified explicitly by using `kfservingOp.after(evaluateOp)` function which assigns `exportOp` as a parent."
